    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is an ivory-white 
        <a href="#">marble mausoleum</a> on the right bank of the river 
        <a href="#">Yamuna</a> in <a href="#">Agra, Uttar Pradesh</a>, India. 
        It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth <a href="#">Mughal emperor</a>, 
        <a href="#">Shah Jahan</a> (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, 
        <a href="#">Mumtaz Mahal</a>; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
        The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a 
        <a href="#">mosque</a> and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded 
        on three sides by a <a href="#">crenellated wall</a>.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases 
        of the project for another five years.The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643,
         of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal.<br> 
         The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost <br>estimated at the time to be around 32 million, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion .
    </p><br>
<p>
The building complex incorporates the design traditions of 
<a href="#">Indo-Islamic architecture</a> and 
<a href="#">Mughal architecture</a>. 
It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. 
While the mausoleum is constructed of 
<a href="#">white marble</a> inlaid with 
<a href="#">semi-precious stones</a>, 
<a href="#">red sandstone</a> was used for other buildings in the complex, 
similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. 
The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans 
under the guidance of a board of architects led by 
<a href="#">Ustad Ahmad Lahori</a>, the emperor's court architect.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The <a href="#">Taj Mahal</a> was designated as a 
<a href="#">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in 1983 for being 
<i>"the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage"</i>. It is regarded as one of the best examples of 
<a href="#">Mughal architecture</a> and a symbol of 
<a href="#">Indian history</a>. 
<br>The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the
<a href="#">New 7 Wonders of the World</a> initiative. 
<br>The Taj Mahal and its setting, surrounding grounds, and structures are a 
<a href="#">Monument of National Importance</a>, administered by the 
<a href="#">Archaeological Survey of India</a>.
